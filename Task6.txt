In the current products application instead of servlets and XSLT transformations 
use Struts classes. So you will have one JDOM object in ActionForm and all lists 
of items will get from there directly using nested names (document.children...) 
Struts feature help. List of products should be redacted having all of the rows 
with input fields. After save action has occurred all of new data fills in the 
JDOM model.
Addition of new product leave through the XSLT transformation. 

Please note that JDOM doesn't have void method setText() that causes Struts can 
not invoke this method through reflection, so you need to add yours void method 
in JDOM library to set element's text.
